### *Approximate* Approximate Bayesian Computation ###


[![ApproxBayes](http://pkg.julialang.org/badges/ApproxBayes_0.6.svg)](http://pkg.julialang.org/detail/ApproxBayes)



Package to implement Approximate Bayesian computation algorithms in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. Package implements basic ABC rejection sampler and sequential monte carlo algorithm (ABC SMC) as in Toni. et al 2009 as well as model selection versions of both (Toni. et al 2010).

## Getting Started
To download the package, from a Julia session run:
```julia
Pkg.clone("git:https://github.com/alavendelm/AABayes.jl.git")
```

## Examples
Here we work through an example following an ABC rejection run.
